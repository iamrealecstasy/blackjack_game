# BlackJack Game (Vanilla Javascript Project)

## Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

On Game load, a "prompt" would be displayed asking you to input your name and the amount you want to come in with. When the START GAME button is clicked two random cards are given each card between number 1-13, numbers greater than 10 returns 10 while 1 returns 13. If the sum of both cards given is 21 then you got BLACKJACK, If the sum of both cards given is greater than 21 then it's GAME OVER. However, if the sum of both card is lesser than 21 clicking on the NEW CARD button would draw out another random card, this process can go on till you get a BLACKJACK or GAME OVER.
